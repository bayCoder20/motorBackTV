VI. Program Inputs
-------------
The program takes three files for input, a properties file, a pair list and a candle/orderSize list.  These files are
read by the program from top to the first blank/empty line.  Any text below this blank line will not effect the operation of the program and can be
used to store alternate lists and notes. The program home directory is where the location of the autoBackTV_vX.XX.jar file is saved.

Properties File - This file contains the configuration options for each back test.

Pair List - This file will be used to acquire the list of pairs that will be tested.  Currently, the format of each pair value can 
be read in the file as carriage return separated values or comma separated values or a combination of both. Each pair can be a combination
of the exchange and currency with a colon for separation (ex. "BINANCE:XRPUSDT") or just the currency (ex. XRPUSDT).  If only the currency is
found, the exchange property in the configuration file will be used as the exchange.  The format of these pairs must be in the same format accepted
in Trading View's pair search box or the pair will not be found and flagged as invalid. See provided sample file.

Candle/OrderSize List - This file will be used to acquire the list of candles and order sizes that will be tested. Currently, the format 
of each candle/orderSize value will be read in the file as comma separated values or carriage return separated values or a combination of both.
Each value must be a combination of a candle and order size separated by a colon (ex. "5:100" = 5 minute candle with 100 order size). The candle size 
value format must match what is acceptable by Trading View or it will not be recognized by Trading View, see below examples and the provided sample file.
	- One digit for minute charts, or first letter of the word for longer candles.
	- Examples: 1, 5, 30, 60, 1440, H, 2H, 6H, D, 5D, 3W, 6M

-------------
VII. Program Outputs
-------------
The program will output four files after each execution: log file, overview data file, overview data CSV file, and a trade list data CSV file.
Samples of these files are provided to help potential users setup the configuration options and test the report generator.

motorBackRunLog - Will include a step by step summary of the program actions and information attempting to describe any encountered issues.
Any pair/candle combination that results in "NO DATA" in the "Strategy Tester" or as an invalid entry will be detected and skipped.
These types of occurrences will be noted in this file for later review by the user.

motorBackRunDataLog.txt - This is a read friendly data file that includes the data points stored in the "Overview" tab of the "Strategy Tester" window.

motorBackData.csv - This is a CSV output of the data points stored in the "Overview" tab of the "Strategy Tester" window.  This file can be imported 
into the supplied Excel Report Generator.

motorBackTradeListData.csv - This is a CSV output of the data stored in the "List of Trades" tab of the "Strategy Tester" window.  This file can 
be imported into the supplied Excel Report Generator.

-------------
VIII. Program Status and Live Options
-------------
After the program starts and initializes the browser window, a small status window will appear showing three cancel/abort options
(Stop After Current Pair, Stop After Current Candle, and ABORT NOW) and three status indicators (Current Pair, Current Candle,
 and a information field with granular program statuses). 

Once a cancel option is clicked, depending on the custom "confirmationPrompt" setting in the properties file, a prompt will show to confirm the action.

-------------
IX. MS Excel Report Generator
-------------
Supplied is a single MS Excel document capable of generating a detailed report of the data collected from the "Overview" and 
"List of Trades" tabs in the "Strategy Tester" window of Trading View.  The Excel document reads the "autoBackOutputs" folder for CSV files to import.
This folder name must remain the same, if changed, a new one will be created. On the first tab of the Excel file, three button options are given, 
"Create Trade Summary Report", "Create Trade List Report", and "Reset Report". The result of each report type will be the creation of 
a "RawData" worksheet that basically stores the data from the imported CSV file, and a separate worksheet for each pair that is tested.	

Create Trade Summary Report - Creates a report that summarizes the "Overview" tab which includes the data points (Net Profit, Total Closed Trades, 
Percent Profitable, Profit Factor, Max Drawdown, Avg Trade, Avg No. of Bars In Trades) and basic graphs for each data point.  
For example, a test with 30 pairs and 30 candles will generate a workbook with 30 worksheets and 210 graphs (7 graphs per worksheet).

Create Trade List Report - Creates a report that summarizes the "List of Trades" tab data that includes the data and generated 
"Equity vs Drawdown" graphs that are shown in the "Overview" tab for each pair. For example, a test with 30 pairs and 10 candles will 
generate a workbook with 30 worksheets and 300 graphs/candles (10 graphs per worksheet). Due to Excel memory limitations, a limit for number of 
graphs that can be generated per worksheet is set at 100. For pairs with more than 100 tested candles, the generated graphs will be split over
multiple worksheets.  For example, a pair with 250 tested candles will require 3 worksheets. Before the report generation starts, a time estimate
will be given for how long the computing process will take to generate larger reports to give the user an option to
wait until a more convenient time.  While the report is being generated, a detailed  progress bar will be shown with information displaying 
the progress status, pair by pair and candle by candle.

NOTE:   Work to improve the functionality of the workbook is ongoing along with charting design/scaling improvements and use of feedback from users. 
		Patience will be needed for generating reports with a large amount of source data. These can take between 15 to 30 minutes to process.
